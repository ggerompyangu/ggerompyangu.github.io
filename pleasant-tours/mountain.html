				<h3>Rwenzori</h3>
				<a href="">download</a>
				<p>The Rwenzoris – the fabled Mountains of the Moon – lie in western Uganda along the Uganda-Congo border. The equatorial snow peaks include the third highest point in Africa, while the lower slopes are blanketed in moorland, bamboo and rich, moist montane forest. Huge tree-heathers and colorful mosses are draped across the mountainsidewith giant lobelias and “everlasting flowers”, creating an enchanting, fairytale scene.

				<h3>Elgon</h3>
				<a href="">download</a>
				<p>At 4,000km²  Mt. Elgon has the largest volcanic base in the world. Located on the Uganda-Kenya border it is also the oldest and largest solitary, volcanic mountain in East Africa. Its vast form, 80km in diameter, rises more than 3,000m above the surrounding plains. The mountain’s cool heights offer respite from the hot plains below, with the higher altitudes providing a refuge for flora and fauna.
Mount Elgon National Park is home to over 300 species of birds, including the endangered Lammergeyer. Small antelopes, forest monkeys, elephants and buffalos also live on the mountainside. The higher slopes are protected by national parks in Uganda and Kenya, creating an extensive trans-boundary conservation area which has been declared a UNESCO Man & Biosphere Reserve.</p>

				<h3>Mufumbiro</h3>
				<a href="">download</a>
				<p>Mufumbiro Mountains ,  volcanic range north of Lake Kivu in east-central Africa, extending about 50 miles (80 km) along the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda. The range runs east-west, perpendicular to the rift valley in which lie Lakes Kivu and Edward. Of its eight major volcanic peaks, the highest is Karisimbi, at 14,787 feet (4,507 metres). The name Virunga (“Volcanoes”), probably of Swahili derivation, has prevailed over the earlier Mufumbiro (“That Which Cooks”), which is still used in Uganda. Individual volcanoes bear Rwandan descriptive names, such as Sabinio (Sabinyo; “Old Man with Large Teeth”) and Muhavura (“Landmark,” or “Guide”).<br>
				The Virunga Mountains rise out of densely populated plateaus that are inhabited mostly by Rwandan cultivators and, in certain areas, by cattle herders. The southern sector of Congo’s Virunga National Park includes those portions of the mountains that are within Congo; the southern flanks of the central and eastern mountains comprise Volcanoes National Park in northwestern Rwanda; and Gorilla National Park includes the Ugandan slopes of Mgahinga. Conservation protects the mountains’ alpine vegetation, as well as wildlife that includes the golden monkey and the mountain gorilla
